# FlowForge ERP: Enterprise Operations Control System

### *Operational Intelligence & Decoupled Decision Orchestration for Modern Manufacturers*

FlowForge ERP is an enterprise-grade Operations Control System (OCS) designed specifically for custom and batch-assembly manufacturers. It replaces disjointed spreadsheets, paper logs, and manual coordination with a unified, real-time transaction and decision-intelligence network. By automatically syncing customer sales velocity with shop floor scheduling, bill-of-materials explosion, raw material shortages detection, and procurement RFQ workflows, FlowForge ensures maximum margin protection and zero material stockouts.

---

## Vision & Industry Context

### Why FlowForge Exists
Traditional ERP solutions—like legacy SAP, Oracle are notoriously complex data graveyards. They are retrospectively input-heavy, recording transaction history *after* delays or stockouts have already disrupted the floor. For medium-sized manufacturers (such as furniture works, machinery fabricators, and assembly plants), a single missing screw, panel, or varnish coat can stall a machine line, freeze work-in-progress (WIP) capital, and lead to missed delivery SLAs.

FlowForge ERP introduces the concept of **active business routing**. Instead of waiting for weekly audits, the platform executes real-time transactional checks at every step of the order lifecycle:
1. **Predictive Dependency Allocation**: Prevents double-allocating free inventory.
2. **Immediate BOM Material Explosion**: Determines material shortages at the exact second a Sales Order is confirmed.
3. **Closed-Loop Procurement**: Bridges shortages directly to automated, competitive supplier RFQs and receipts quality verification.

### Business Value Metrics
* **Lead-Time Reduction**: Shrinks the sales-to-manufacturing release cycle from weeks to minutes.
* **WIP Cost Control**: Minimizes holding costs by procuring raw components on a Make-to-Order (MTO) or strict safety stock replenishment schedule.
* **Margin Safeguards**: Side-by-side vendor quotation evaluations lock in the lowest cost materials.
* **Regulatory Compliance**: Retains a non-repudiable audit trail of every record creation, status change, and inventory adjustment.

## System Architecture

FlowForge ERP uses a **decoupled transaction and intelligence architecture**. Crucial database mutations and ledger adjustments are processed in a highly secure, transaction-safe Next.js server environment. Meanwhile, operational intelligence analysis, NLP chat interactions, and predictive reorder calculations are offloaded to a FastAPI service running a LangGraph-state reasoning pipeline.

### Core Architecture Flow
1. **UI Layer**: React Server and Client Components render responsive dashboard panels. Client-side caching and mutations are managed by **TanStack Query**, reducing duplicate API calls.
2. **Security & Session Layer**: Verification middleware validates stateless HTTP-only JWT cookies before requests reach API route handlers.
3. **Prisma ORM Layer**: Interacts with PostgreSQL using connection-pooled transaction pipelines. Multi-table inserts (e.g. Sales Order & Sales Order Items) are wrapped in atomic transactions.
4. **FastAPI Agent Gateway**: The Next.js API layer compiles a live context JSON string representing KPIs, active runs, and shortages. It POSTs this context to FastAPI's `/api/insights` endpoint. This design eliminates direct database exposure by the AI engine, ensuring data security.
5. **LangGraph Agent Workflow**: The FastAPI agent processes natural language user queries, selects authorized SQL tools, validates user permissions based on user role variables, and returns markdown-formatted answers.

## End-to-End Business Workflow

The central business workflow tracks an order through sales, product planning, procurement, inventory receipt, manufacturing, and delivery:

```
[Customer Request] ──► [Sales: Draft SO] ──► [Confirm & Check Stock]
                                                     │
                                                     ├─► (Ready) ───────────┐
                                                     │                      │
                                                     └─► (Shortage)         │
                                                             │              │
                                                             ▼              ▼
[Complete Delivery] ◄── [Complete MO] ◄── [Approve MO] ◄── [Confirm Receipt] ◄── [RFQ/PO confirmed]
```

### 1. Customer Request to Sales Order Check
* **Role**: Sales Executive (`priya@shivfurniture.com`).
* **Workflow**: Enters a customer order. The system checks standard warehouse stock:
    $$\text{Free Quantity} = \text{On-Hand Quantity} - \text{Reserved Quantity}$$
* **Stock Check Options**:
    * *All Available*: Order updates to `ready`, allocating stock.
    * *Shortage Detected*: Reserves available stock, updates status to `shortage_detected`, explodes the BOM to evaluate missing components, and logs details in order notes.

### 2. Production Demand Analysis
* **Role**: Product Manager (`ravi@shivfurniture.com`).
* **Workflow**: Creates a manufacturing order for the shortage. If raw materials are missing (e.g. table legs or timber boards), the system flags the MO as `WAITING_FOR_PROCUREMENT` and creates a draft PO.

### 3. Procurement & Quotations Evaluation
* **Role**: Procurement Manager (`amit@shivfurniture.com`).
* **Workflow**: Verifies the draft PO and clicks "Send RFQ" to vendors. The system generates bids with delivery estimates. Amit compares quotes, selects a vendor, and confirms the PO, creating a pending vendor Invoice.

### 4. Quality Inspection & Stocking
* **Role**: Inventory Manager (`neha@shivfurniture.com`).
* **Workflow**: Receives the supplier cargo. Checks the package counts and details. Approves the receipt, increasing raw material stock and updating the linked MO status to `READY_TO_START`.

### 5. Shop Floor Production Run
* **Role**: Product Manager (`ravi@shivfurniture.com`).
* **Workflow**: Launches the MO on an active machine line. Raw material quantities are deducted, and once assembly is complete, Ravi clicks "Complete". Finished goods stock increases and is reserved for the sales order, which automatically updates to `ready`.

### 6. Delivery Dispatch
* **Role**: Sales Executive (`priya@shivfurniture.com`).
* **Workflow**: Priya sees the sales order status is `ready` and clicks "Deliver". Finished goods are dispatched to the customer, and reservations are cleared.

## Data Flow Architecture

This model outlines the system's database write actions, showing the flow from user action to UI update:

```
User Action on UI  ──►  TanStack Mutation  ──►  API Route Guard  ──►  Service Layer
                                                                          │
                                                                          ▼
UI Re-renders  ◄──  Cache Invalidation  ◄──  Success Response  ◄──  DB Transaction
```

1. **User Action**: The user submits a form (e.g., procurement receipt verification).
2. **TanStack Mutation**: React triggers a TanStack query mutation hook, converting state to a JSON payload.
3. **API Route Guard**: Verification middleware validates the JWT token cookie and ensures the user role has write permissions.
4. **Service Layer**: The request is routed to the service layer, which wraps database mutations in a Prisma `$transaction` block to guarantee transaction safety.
5. **Database Transaction**: PostgreSQL writes the changes, updating records and log lines.
6. **Success Response**: The service layer triggers an audit log entry and returns the updated database objects.
7. **Cache Invalidation**: TanStack Query invalidates cache keys, prompting background queries to fetch fresh database state.
8. **UI Re-render**: Responsive dashboard widgets re-render with updated values, reflecting the changes.

## Security Architecture

```
[Secure HTTP-Only Cookies]  ──►  [JWT Verification Middleware]  ──►  [API Route Guards]
                                                                             │
                                                                             ▼
[PostgreSQL Database]  ◄──  [ACID Transactions (Prisma)]  ◄──  [Audit Logging Hook]
```

* **Authentication**: Users log in via `/api/auth/login`. Sessions are managed using stateless JWTs stored in secure, HTTP-only cookies to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
* **API Guards**: API routes restrict access using middleware role validation:
    ```typescript
    const result = await requireRole('admin', 'purchase');
    if (result instanceof Response) return result; // Blocks unauthorized access
    ```
* **Database Transactions**: Prisma transactions verify stock levels before database mutations, preventing double-selling or incorrect adjustments.
* **Access Control Sandbox**: Includes a test role switcher in development mode, allowing developers to switch roles instantly and test user journeys with the password `Admin@123`.

---

## Audit & Compliance Log System

FlowForge records database mutations in the `audit_logs` table.

### What is Recorded
Each entry captures:
* **User Context**: `userId`, `userName`, `userRole`.
* **Action Type**: Event classification (e.g., `sales_order_confirmed`, `stock_adjusted`).
* **Target Entity**: Entity category (`entityType`, `entityId`, `entityName`).
* **Value Snapshot**: Pre-change (`oldValues`) and post-change (`newValues`) states stored in JSONB format.

### Why it Matters
* **Operator Traceability**: Tracks inventory write actions to specific users, reducing mistakes and human error.
* **System Traceability**: Logs automatic updates, showing when shortages were resolved or BOMs exploded.
* **Regulatory Compliance**: Retains historical record changes, simplifying security audits.

## Scalability & Enterprise Readiness

FlowForge ERP is structured to scale:
* **Connection Pooling**: Uses connection poolers (e.g. pgBouncer) to handle database connections.
* **Database Indexing**: Performance indexes are placed on frequently queried columns (`sku`, `role`, `status`, `referenceSoId`), keeping query execution times low under heavy load.
* **Query Caching**: TanStack Query manages client-side caching, minimizing duplicate database queries.
* **Stateless Operations**: Next.js serverless functions and FastAPI are stateless, allowing them to be scaled horizontally across container networks (e.g., Kubernetes).

## Development Architecture & Codebase Design

The codebase uses a clean, service-oriented structure:

```
frontend/
├── app/
│   ├── (auth)/             # Authentication pages
│   ├── (dashboard)/        # Main business pages
│   └── api/                # REST API route handlers
├── components/             # Reusable UI components
├── hooks/                  # TanStack Query query/mutation hooks
├── lib/server/
│   ├── modules/            # Service layers (CRUD & business logic)
│   └── utils/              # Helper utilities
├── prisma/                 # Database schema & seed configurations
└── services/               # API clients
```

### Key Design Patterns
* **Service Layer Pattern**: Database logic is isolated inside class files (e.g., [`SalesService`](file:///c:/FlowForge-ERP/frontend/lib/server/modules/sales/sales.service.ts)), separating business rules from API route endpoints.
* **Transactional Safety**: Prisma transactions protect write actions, rolling back mutations if an error occurs.
* **API clients separation**: Next.js pages interact with APIs via dedicated services, keeping page code clean and testable.
